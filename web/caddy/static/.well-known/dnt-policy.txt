Do Not Track Compliance Policy

This domain ignores the "Do Not Track" or "DNT" header, mostly because I don't
track very much anyways. This website contains no client-side analytics or
tracking software; the server-side analytics is just my web server's request log
combined with GoAccess (https://goaccess.io/). This data will be kept private
(unless I screw up a security setting) except for aggregate statistics, and it
will be retained for however long my web server defaults to (probably 30 days).

Some pages on this website may allow you to create an account or log in. On
those pages, I will retain any information that you specifically provide to me
since that is the entire intent of the service.
